# Express Typescript IOC Boilerplate

This is a dead-simple Express Typescript with IOC boilerplate.

> NOTE: It doesn't come any batteriers includes, which is very ideal for spinning up domain specific microservices.

## What's included?
- Express
- Typescript
- IOC
- Github Action
- Testing (with Travis configured)

### Why a new boilerplate?

Prior to this moment, I was in need of super simple boilerplate for express, typescript & IOC only, and all the ones I saw were bloated with several utilites that isn't reasonable, especially when you want to spin up a microservice aimed at solving one domain specific problem and not an entire app.
